## ðŸ“¦ Examples

## Resume Classification:
  Classifies resumes into job categories using TF-IDF and Decision Trees. Includes preprocessing, feature extraction, and evaluation with accuracy score.
## Movie Review sentiment:
  Classifies movie reviews into positive, negative sentiments using TF-IDF and Decision Trees. Includes preprocessing, feature extraction, and evaluation with accuracy score.

## Spam Classification: 
  Detects spam messages using logistic regression and TF-IDF features. Includes data cleaning, model training, and performance metrics.
## Customer chrun prediction:
   Customer churn prediction using SVM with preprocessing, feature encoding, and evaluation to classify whether a customer is likely to churn based on behavioral and subscription data.

## Diabetes disease Prediction: 
   predict whether a patient has diabetes based on diagnostic measurements using naive bayes(Gaussian NB model).
